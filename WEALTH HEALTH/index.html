        <div><p>There are 4 main blood groups (types of blood) – A, B, AB and O. <br>Your blood group is determined by the genes you inherit from your parents. Each group can be either <br>RhD positive or RhD negative, which means in total there are 8 blood groups.</p></div>
        <div><p>Blood is made up of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets in a liquid called plasma. Your blood group<br> is identified by antibodies and antigens in the blood.</p></div>

     </div> 
        <div><p>There are 4 main blood groups defined by the ABO system:<br>

            blood group A – has A antigens on the red blood cells with anti-B antibodies in the plasma<br>
            blood group B – has B antigens with anti-A antibodies in the plasma<br>
            blood group O – has no antigens, but both anti-A and anti-B antibodies in the plasma<br>
            blood group AB – has both A and B antigens, but no antibodies<br>
            Blood group O is the most common blood group. Almost half of the UK population (around 48%) has blood group O.<br>
            
            Receiving blood from the wrong ABO group can be life-threatening. For example, if someone with group B blood is given group A blood, their anti-A antibodies will attack the group A cells.<br>
            
            This is why group A blood must never be given to someone who has group B blood and vice versa.<br>
            
            As group O red blood cells do not have any A or B antigens, it can safely be given to any other group.</p>

            <div><p>Blood group test
                To find out your blood group, a sample of your blood has to be taken and tested.<br> However, GPs do not routinely check people's blood group.
                
                <br>You can find out your blood group by giving blood.
                
                For the blood group test, <br>your red blood cells are mixed with different antibody solutions. If, for example,<br> the solution contains anti-B antibodies and you have B antigens on your cells (you're blood group B), it will clump together.
                
                If the blood does not react to any of the anti-A or anti-B antibodies,<br> it's blood group O. A series of tests with different types of antibody can be used to identify your blood group.
                
                <br>If you have a blood transfusion (where blood is taken from one person and given to another) your blood will be tested against a sample of donor cells that contain ABO and RhD antigens.<br> If there's no reaction, donor blood with the same ABO and RhD type can be used.
                
                
               
                <br>Pregnant women are always given a blood group test.<br> This is because if the mother is RhD negative but the child has inherited RhD-positive blood from the father, it could cause complications if left untreated.<br>
                
                RhD-negative women of child-bearing age should always only receive RhD-negative blood.

                Giving blood
                Most people are able to give blood, but a lot fewer people than are needed to meet demand actually do.
                
                You can usually donate blood if you:
                
                are fit and healthy
                weigh between 50kg (7st 12lb) and 158kg (25st)
                are 17 to 65 years old</p></div>
